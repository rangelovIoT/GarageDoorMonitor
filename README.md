# GarageDoorMonitor
This project is designed to monitor the state of a garage door using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Wi-Fi. It scans for BLE signals from a specific sensor and determines whether the garage door is open or closed based on the X-axis values provided by the sensor. When the state of the garage door changes, it sends a notification via Telegram.
